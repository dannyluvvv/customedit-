# customedit-basicbackground

The ground stone for this theme was the [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) Theme by DevilBro. 

I made various small changes to this template which I will list below.

TBF - To be Fixed
WIP - Work in Progress

Changes to template: 
- Background (the basicbackground was replaced by a moving cloud gif, optionally replaceable by another [pink clouds](https://imgur.com/s2rCM7Y) image seen above)
- some custom changes to the enter-message-bar which is now overlaying the members-list and looks pretty cool
- pink/rose themed buttons and text
- minor transparency changes for looks
- stronger shadow boxes
- bit more rounded, less boxy stair-like way

Known flaws:
- date display for above first message of the day has weird corner issue
- general issue with rounded corners on overlaying boxes
- when in call, the vc-control-account-box expands creating weird step between vc-control-account-box with vc-control and enter-message-bar (WIP)
- ~~profile modal not transparent enough (TBF)~~ profile modal too transparent for readability (TBF)
- small visual issue at bottom right corner with enter-message-bar and members-list (WIP)
- shadow inconsistencies (WIP)

All in all this theme is still a work in progress. I am a beginner in this field, that's why this is just a simple css template edit.
