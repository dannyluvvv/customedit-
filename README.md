# CLOUDS

The ground stone for this theme was the [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) Theme by DevilBro. <br>

I made various small changes to this template which I will list below. <br>

### DISCLAIMERS <br>
- red marked 'read all' button not included --> vencord plugin 
- the discord logo is nitro only

### CHANGES TO DEVILBROS [BASICBACKGROUND](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) TEMPLATE <br>
Changes to template: <br>
- Background (the basicbackground was replaced by a moving cloud gif, optionally replaceable by another [pink clouds](https://imgur.com/s2rCM7Y) image seen above)
- some custom changes to the enter-message-bar which is now overlaying the members-list and looks pretty cool
- pink/rose themed buttons and text
- minor transparency changes for looks
- stronger shadow boxes
- bit more rounded, less boxy stair-like way

### FIXES/CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS <br>
TBF - To be Fixed <br>
WIP - Work in Progress <br>
AONFIX - As of Now Fixed <br>
AONUNK - As of Now Unknown .... issue not found/not appearing --> potentially fixed indirectly <br>
<br>

Known flaws: <br>
- date display for above first message of the day has weird corner issue (WIP)
- weird date display inconsistency in private messaging and server messaging, where the background of the date display displays the background squished first and after changing to privatemessaging and back it fixes itself (WIP)
- general issue with rounded corners on overlaying boxes (AONUNK)
- when in call, the vc-control-account-box expands creating weird step between vc-control-account-box with vc-control and enter-message-bar (WIP)
- profile modal not transparent enough (WIP)
- small visual issue at bottom right corner with enter-message-bar and members-list (WIP)
- shadow inconsistencies with the member-list (WIP)

### FINAL WORDS <br>
All in all this theme is still a work in progress. I am a beginner in this field, that's why this is just a simple css template edit. <br>
