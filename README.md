#Clouds 
This was a great theme, but since I'm really bad at making discord themes I'm not gonna do any updates on this for now.
Discord once again made some changes, or I just don't understand how to adress the different elements of discord, but the theme doesn't work anymore. 
It's probably just a mather of fixing the class and id's in the css. However, it will end up broken after another discord update.

Thanks for those who used it, and thanks for those who supported me. I'm gonna learn more and more, and maybe try another run.
