# customedit-basicbackground

The ground stone for this theme was the [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) Theme by DevilBro. 

I made various changes to this template which I will list not in detail below.

Changes to template: 
- Background (basicbackground was replaced by a moving cloud gif, optionally replaceable by another [pink clouds](https://imgur.com/s2rCM7Y) image seen above)
- some custom changes to the enter-message-bar which is now overlaying the members-list and looks pretty cool
- pink themed buttons and text
- minor transparency changes for looks
- stronger shadow boxes

Known flaws:
- gap below members-list --> design flaw
- date display for above first message of the day has weird corner issue
- general issue with rounded corners on overlaying boxes
- when in call, the vc-control-account-box expands creating weird step between vc-control-account-box with vc-control and enter-message-bar
- profile modal not transparent enough
- small visual issue at bottom right corner with enter-message-bar and members-list
- shadow inconsistencies

All in all this theme is still a work in progress. I am a beginner in this field, that's why this is just a simple css template edit.
