# customedit-basicbackground

The ground stone for this theme was the [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) Theme by DevilBro. 

I made various changes to this template which I will list not in detail below.

Changes to template: 



- Background (basicbackground was replaced by a moving cloud gif, optionally replaceable by another [pink clouds](https://imgur.com/s2rCM7Y) image seen above)
- some custom changes to the enter-message-bar which is now overlaying the members-list and looks pretty cool
- pink themed buttons and text (some areas have a problem with not readable text)
- minor transparency changes for looks
- stronger shadow boxes

All in all this theme is still a work in progress. I am a beginner in this field, that's why this is just a simple css template edit.
