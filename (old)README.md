# CLOUDS

The ground stone for this theme was the [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) Theme by DevilBro. <br>

I made various changes to this template which I will list below. <br>

 **This theme will be laggy on low-end pcs or laptops, because it uses transparency in it's nature.**

### DISCLAIMERS <br>
- red marked 'read all' button not included --> vencord plugin 
- the discord logo is nitro only
- other red marked icons are only vencord plugin features and aren't included in theme
- the asthetic version is currently a WIP however feel free to use it and give me feedback
- **this was all done in css<br>
<br>
**i'm a beginner so no advanced code was used<br>


### CHANGES TO TEMPLATE <br>
- Background (the basicbackground was replaced by [pink clouds](https://imgur.com/s2rCM7Y) like in the image seen above and optionally a gif of moving clouds like with the gif version)
- in the ***aesthetic* version**: 'type-message' bar now stretching over the bottom and looks pretty cool 
- pink/rose themed buttons and text
- minor transparency changes for looks
- stronger shadow boxes
- bit more rounded, less boxy stair-like way in ***aesthetic*** version (WIP) <br>

<br>

#### KNOWN FLAWS: <br>

- ~~small visual issue at bottom right corner with enter-message-bar and members-list~~ (AOUNK)

- general shadow inconsistencies with the channel choice and channel text view (WIP)
- when in call, the vc-control-account-box expands creating weird step between vc-control-account-box with vc-control and enter-message-bar (WIP*)
- down left vc/stream icons are inconsistent in color with text right next to it (WFASAP) <br>

### FINAL WORDS <br>
All in all this theme is still a work in progress. I am a beginner in this field, that's why this is just a simple css template edit. <br>
